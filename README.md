# MarketInk Quality Gate

A **read-only code scanner** that runs your existing quality tools (linters, type
checkers, security & dependency scanners) plus an optional scoped **AI review**
with Claude, and produces one clean report.

It is a single Node script (`scan.js`, **zero npm dependencies**) that is safe to
run on **any project, at any time** — including production repos — because it
**never changes anything**.

> **This README is the one and only doc.** Setup, features, daily usage,
> onboarding, config, git/CI automation, and troubleshooting are all below.

## 1. What it is & safety guarantees

The Quality Gate splits code review in a way that plays to each tool's strength:

- **Deterministic tools** (linters/type/security/dependency scanners) handle
  everything mechanical — always right, cost nothing to run.
- **Claude (AI)** handles judgment calls — reading *only your diff* against *your*
  standards (from the project's `CLAUDE.md`) and explaining real issues in plain
  language: security holes, broken business logic, bad architecture, perf traps.

**The single most important fact: it is 100% read-only.**

- ✅ **Never edits, formats, or fixes your code.** Every tool runs in check-only
  mode (`ruff check --no-fix`, `prettier --check`, `mypy`, `npm audit`,
  `gitleaks detect`, …). No `--fix`/`--write` flags anywhere.
- ✅ **Never changes git state.** No add, commit, push, or checkout.
- ✅ **Never installs anything.** It only runs tools already available.
- ✅ **Can't break a build.** A missing tool is *skipped*, not failed. Exit code is
  `0` by default; `--strict` (opt-in) is the only way it returns non-zero.
- ✅ **Zero-touch on the scanned project.** Point it at a repo from outside with
  `--path`; nothing is written into that repo. The only file it ever writes is a
  report, in an output folder you choose — or nothing at all with `--no-report`.

### The mental model (four ideas explain 90% of it)

| Idea | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Read-only** | Runs everything in *check* mode. There is **no** `--fix`/`--write` anywhere. |
| **Auto-detect** | It only runs a tool that's already installed. A missing tool becomes `SKIP`, never an error. A repo with no Python tools simply shows every Python row as `SKIP`. |
| **Scoped by default** | With no flags it scans **only the files that changed** vs your base branch (`origin/main`, `main`, …) — you see issues in *new* code, not a wall of legacy noise ("clean as you code"). |
| **AI is diff-based** | The Claude review only runs on a diff. `--all` disables AI on purpose (reviewing a whole repo would be noisy and expensive). |

> The everyday use case: run it with **no flags** on a repo you're actively working
> in, right before you commit or open a PR. You get a short list of issues **in the
> code you just wrote**, plus an AI review of your diff.

---

## 2. Features — what it runs

| Check | Tool | Mode | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lint (Python) | `ruff check` | read-only | changed files |
| Format (Python) | `ruff format --check` | read-only | changed files |
| Types (Python) | `mypy` | read-only | changed files |
| Security (Python) | `bandit` | read-only | changed files |
| Dependencies (Python) | `pip-audit` | read-only | project |
| Lint (JS/TS) | `eslint` | read-only | changed files |
| Format (JS/TS) | `prettier --check` | read-only | changed files |
| Types (JS/TS) | `tsc --noEmit` | read-only | project |
| Dependencies (JS/TS) | `npm audit` | read-only | project |
| Secrets | `gitleaks detect` | read-only | working tree |
| Supabase (RLS/keys/grants) | *built-in* (no tool) | read-only | changed code + `.sql` |
| AI review | `claude -p` | read-only | the diff |

Deterministic tools own anything mechanical. The AI review is reserved for
judgment — security, business logic, architecture, performance, maintainability —
and is **scoped to the diff** and run in an isolated temp directory so it has
nothing in your project to touch.

> React/Next are just JS/TS to the scanner — ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript cover
> them. The language the tool is *written in* (Node) is unrelated to the languages
> it *scans*: it's an orchestrator that shells out to each stack's tools.

---

## 3. Requirements & setup

**Node.js 18+ and nothing else** (Node 20+ recommended). The scanner is a single
dependency-free script — `node scan.js` just works, no `npm install`.

The actual checks are **optional and auto-detected** — install whichever a project
uses; the gate runs what's there and skips the rest.

### The golden rule of where tools live

| Tool type | Where it must be installed | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Python** (`ruff`, `mypy`, `bandit`, `pip-audit`) | Global or the project's virtualenv (on your `PATH`) | The scanner looks for them on PATH |
| **JS/TS** (`eslint`, `prettier`, `typescript`) | **Inside the project** as dev deps (`node_modules/.bin`) | The scanner looks in the project's `node_modules` |
| **`gitleaks`** (secrets) | Global (on your `PATH`) | Works on any project |
| **`claude`** (AI review) | Global (on your `PATH`) | Optional; if absent, AI step is skipped |

```bash
# Python projects (global, or inside the project's venv)
pip install ruff mypy bandit pip-audit

# JS/TS/React/Next projects — install as dev deps INSIDE the project
npm install -D eslint prettier typescript

# Secret scanning (one binary, any project)
winget install gitleaks.gitleaks      # Windows
brew install gitleaks                 # macOS
# Linux: download from https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/releases

# AI review (optional): install Claude Code so `claude` is on PATH
```

> You don't need all of these. With **none** installed the scanner still runs,
> skips everything gracefully, and tells you what to install.

### Make it a one-word command (recommended)

You'll run this constantly, so add an alias.

**Windows (PowerShell `$PROFILE`):**
```powershell
function qg { node E:\MarketInk\Quality_Gate\quality-gate\scan.js @args }
```

**macOS / Linux (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):**
```bash
qg() { node /path/to/quality-gate/scan.js "$@"; }
```

Reload your shell — now from *any* project you just type `qg`. Wrappers also ship:
`quality.ps1` on Windows and `./quality` on macOS/Linux (both pass all args through).

---

## 4. Quick start & daily usage

Run from inside a repo, or point at one with `--path`.

```bash
# Scan the changed files in the current repo (+ AI review of the diff):
node scan.js            # or: qg

# Zero-touch scan of another project (nothing written into it):
node scan.js --path ../some-service

# Full health check of the whole project (no AI):
node scan.js --all --no-ai
```

### Where reports land (the one thing people trip on)

- **`--path`** = the project you *scan* (defaults to the current folder).
- **Reports are written to the folder you *run the command from*** — as
  `./quality-reports/` — **not** into the scanned project (unless you `cd` there or
  pass `--out`).

**Option A — stand inside the project (most intuitive):**
```powershell
cd E:\path\to\my-project
qg      # report → E:\path\to\my-project\quality-reports\latest.md
```

**Option B — stand in the tool folder, scan from outside (zero-touch):**
```powershell
cd E:\MarketInk\Quality_Gate\quality-gate
node scan.js --path E:\path\to\my-project
# report → E:\MarketInk\Quality_Gate\quality-gate\quality-reports\latest.md
```

### The recipes you'll actually use

| I want to… | Command |
|---|---|
| **Daily driver** — check my changes + AI review | `qg` |
| Fast check, no AI (offline, just linters) | `qg --no-ai` |
| Deep review before a big PR (all 6 AI reviewers) | `qg --ai-full` |
| Check only what's staged (pre-commit) | `qg --staged` |
| Review everything since a release/tag | `qg --base v1.4.0` |
| Scan a **different** repo, zero-touch | `qg --path ../other-repo` |
| One-time full audit of a legacy repo (no AI) | `qg --path ../repo --all --no-ai` |
| Print only, write nothing | `qg --no-report` |
| CI gate (exit 1 on findings) | `qg --staged --no-ai --strict` |
| Slow/huge repo | `qg --timeout 1200` |
| See all options | `qg --help` |

> AI review needs `claude` on PATH and a **diff** — it's skipped on `--all` and on
> an empty diff. Deterministic checks need their tools installed (§3); missing ones
> just `SKIP`.

---

## 5. Options / flags

```
--path PATH     repo to scan (default: current directory)
--all           scan the whole project instead of just changes (disables AI)
--staged        scan only git-staged changes
--base REF      git base ref for the diff (default: auto-detect origin/main…)
--no-ai         skip the AI review
--ai-full       run all 6 specialized AI reviewers (review/security/architecture/
                performance/business-logic/supabase)
--no-report     print to the console only; write no files anywhere
--out DIR       report output directory (default: ./quality-reports)
--strict        exit 1 if any findings (for optional CI gating)
--timeout SEC   per-tool timeout (default: 600)
```

**How scope is decided:**
- In a git repo it scans **changed files vs the base branch** by default
  (auto-detects `origin/main`, `main`, …). This keeps reports focused and is why
  it's safe on large codebases — you see issues in *new* code, not legacy noise.
- `--all` scans everything; `--staged` scans staged changes only.
- Not a git repo? It automatically falls back to `--all`.

**Exit codes:** `0` = ran fine (even with findings). `1` = only with `--strict`
*and* there were findings. `2` = bad `--path`. That's why it's safe in CI by
default — it can't fail your build unless you opt in with `--strict`.

---

## 6. Reading the report

Every run writes three files into `quality-reports/`:

- **`latest.md`** — human-readable. **Read this one.**
- **`latest.json`** — same data, machine-readable (`{ meta, checks, reviews }`), for
  dashboards/automation.
- **`report-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`** — timestamped history, one per run.

Each check has a status:

| Status | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| **PASS** | Tool ran, found nothing | 🎉 Nothing to do |
| **FINDINGS** | Tool ran, found issues | Read the **Details** section and fix them |
| **SKIP** | Tool not installed, or nothing in scope | Install the tool (§3) if you want that check |
| **ERROR** | Tool crashed or timed out | See §10 — usually a missing lockfile or a real timeout |
| **OFF** | Disabled in config | You turned it off in `quality-gate.config.json` |

- The **Details** section lists only `FINDINGS` and `ERROR` checks, each with the
  *exact command it ran* and the raw output — so you can reproduce it yourself.
- The **AI Review** section is Claude's prose analysis of your diff: each issue gets
  a `file:line` estimate, a severity (high/med/low), the problem in one sentence,
  and a concrete fix. If it found nothing, it says so.

> A `SKIP` or `ERROR` never means the scanner failed — it means a *tool* was missing
> or a *project* has a gap. The scanner cannot break your build and made no changes.

---

## 7. Configuration

There are two layers:

1. **The scanner's own config** — `quality-gate.config.json` (optional).
2. **Each tool's own config** — the normal `ruff`, `eslint`, `tsconfig`, etc. files
   in the project. The gate just *runs* these; it respects the project's existing
   rules and never invents its own.

### `quality-gate.config.json`

Lives next to `scan.js`. Delete it and safe defaults still apply.

```json
{
  "base_ref": null,
  "disabled_checks": []
}
```

- **`base_ref`** — default git ref to diff against. `null` = auto-detect
  (`origin/main` → `main` → …). Set it if your default branch is unusual (e.g.
  `"origin/develop"`).
- **`disabled_checks`** — check ids you never want to run. Valid ids: `ruff`,
  `ruff-format`, `mypy`, `bandit`, `pip-audit`, `eslint`, `prettier`, `tsc`,
  `npm-audit`, `gitleaks`, `supabase`. Example — silence npm audit and secrets:
  `["npm-audit", "gitleaks"]`.

### Give Claude your project's rules — `CLAUDE.md`

The highest-leverage config for context-aware review. Drop a `CLAUDE.md` at the
project root and the AI review treats its rules as the standard it reviews against.
A template ships with the tool:

```bash
cp quality-gate/.quality/standards/CLAUDE.template.md  <your-project>/CLAUDE.md
```

Fill in your stack, architecture rules, API conventions, and security rules as
concrete "always/never" statements, e.g.:

```
- Never access the database directly from controllers. Always go through the service layer.
- Never build SQL by string concatenation — use parameterized queries.
- Every API endpoint validates its input before use.
- Never log secrets, tokens, or PII.
```

The more concrete the rules, the more objective and useful the AI review.

---

## 8. Supabase checks

Many of our projects use Supabase, where **Row Level Security (RLS) is the main
access control** — every `public` table is exposed over an auto-generated REST API,
and the `service_role` key bypasses RLS entirely. Generic linters know none of
this, so the gate ships a **built-in Supabase check** plus a **Supabase AI
reviewer**. Nothing to install; it auto-detects Supabase (a `supabase/` dir,
`@supabase/*` in `package.json`, or `supabase`/`createClient` in the scanned code)
and shows `SKIP` on projects that don't use it.

**Deterministic check (`supabase`)** — concrete "always/never" signatures scanned
over changed code + `.sql` migrations:

| It flags | Severity | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `service_role`/secret key behind a browser-exposed env var (`NEXT_PUBLIC_`, `VITE_`, `REACT_APP_`, …) | HIGH | Ships full-DB-access credentials to the client |
| A hardcoded secret key (`sb_secret_…`) or a `service_role` JWT in source | HIGH | Leaks a key that bypasses RLS |
| `service_role` referenced in a client (`'use client'`) file | HIGH | The service role must never reach the browser |
| `... disable row level security` in a migration | HIGH | Table becomes fully readable/writable with the anon key |
| `create table …` with no `enable row level security` in the same file | MEDIUM | New table left unprotected |
| `grant … to anon`/`public` (write = MEDIUM, read = LOW) | MED/LOW | Exposes data via the REST API; prefer RLS policies |
| `service_role` referenced inside a `create policy` | MEDIUM | Likely a misconfiguration — service_role already bypasses RLS |

> The anon key hardcoded in client code is **not** flagged — it's designed to be
> public. RLS, not key secrecy, is what protects your data.

**AI reviewer (`supabase`)** — runs under `qg --ai-full` and handles the judgment a
regex can't: RLS *coverage & correctness* (`USING (true)`, missing `WITH CHECK`),
ownership/IDOR (queries not scoped to `auth.uid()`), `security definer` RPC
functions, public storage buckets, and sensitive columns exposed to clients. Add
your Supabase rules to the project's `CLAUDE.md` to make it context-aware.

## 9. Onboarding a project & git automation

Each project is onboarded **once**, then the gate runs automatically on `git commit`
(fast, staged, deterministic) and `git push` (fuller review vs the base branch).
You have three levels of automation — adopt them in order, as trust grows.

### One-time onboarding (installs the hooks)

Windows:
```powershell
cd quality-gate
.\hooks\install-hooks.ps1 -Repo C:\path\to\your-project
```
macOS/Linux:
```bash
cd quality-gate
./hooks/install-hooks.sh /path/to/your-project
```

The installer, entirely inside the target repo:
1. Vendors the scanner into `<repo>/.quality-gate/` (so it travels with the repo).
2. Installs `pre-commit` + `pre-push` into `<repo>/.githooks/`.
3. Runs `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.
4. Adds `quality-reports/` to `.gitignore`.

Then commit the setup so it ships with the repo:
```bash
git add .githooks .quality-gate .gitignore
git commit -m "Add MarketInk Quality Gate hooks"
```

**Files added by this setup:**

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `<repo>/.quality-gate/` | vendored scanner (committed with the repo) |
| `<repo>/.githooks/pre-commit` | fast staged scan on commit |
| `<repo>/.githooks/pre-push` | fuller scan on push |

### Level 1 & 2 — Local hooks (behaviour & toggles)

| Hook | Default | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `pre-commit` | notify only, never blocks | staged changes, no AI (fast) |
| `pre-push` | notify only, never blocks | changed vs base, no AI |

Set as env vars:
- `QG_BLOCK=1` → **abort** the commit/push if there are findings.
- `QG_AI=1` → include the Claude AI review on push (slower).
- `git commit/push --no-verify` → bypass the hook (git's built-in escape hatch).

> **The honest catch about "everyone gets it on pull":** git **deliberately** does
> not run hooks that arrive via `clone`/`pull` (auto-running fetched code would be a
> security hole). So there is always **one** action per developer per clone:
> `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. That's unavoidable for *local* hooks — which
> is why CI (below) is the real enforcement layer.

### Level 3 — CI on every Pull Request (the team standard, unskippable)

A ready-made GitHub Actions workflow ships at `.github/workflows/quality-scan.yml`.
It runs on every PR (and manual dispatch), scans the **PR diff**
(`--base origin/<base_branch>`), is **`continue-on-error: true`** (never fails the
build yet), uploads the report as a downloadable artifact, **and posts the report
straight onto the PR as a comment** (updating the same comment on re-runs).

**Set it up in a project:**

1. Copy the workflow in:
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item E:\MarketInk\Quality_Gate\quality-gate\.github\workflows\quality-scan.yml `
             E:\path\to\my-project\.github\workflows\
   ```
2. Add to the project's `.gitignore`:
   ```
   quality-reports/
   .quality-gate-tool/
   ```
3. Commit and open a PR. The workflow clones the scanner from
   `https://github.com/sarthakkk1212/quality-gate.git` at run time, scans the PR
   diff, and posts results as a PR comment. For the comment to post, enable repo
   **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → "Read and write
   permissions"** (the workflow already declares `pull-requests: write`). PRs from
   *forks* get a read-only token, so the comment step is skipped there (the artifact
   still uploads).
4. **To run deterministic tools in CI too**, uncomment the install step and list
   what the repo uses (e.g. `pip install ruff mypy bandit pip-audit`; for JS/TS add
   an `npm ci` step so `node_modules` exists).
5. **Make it blocking later** — once the false-positive rate is low and the team
   trusts the signal, flip `continue-on-error: true` → `false` (and add `--strict`)
   so a PR with findings fails the check.

> **AI review in CI** uses `--no-ai` by default because the `claude` CLI needs
> credentials. To enable it: install Claude Code in the workflow, provide API
> credentials via GitHub **Secrets**, and drop `--no-ai`.

### The end-to-end flow (the whole point)

```
Developer writes code
        │  (local)  qg  ──► fix issues in your own diff, privately. Fast loop.
        ▼
  git commit ──► pre-commit hook (advisory)            [Level 1]
        ▼
  git push   ──► pre-push hook (QG_BLOCK=1 blocks)      [Level 2]
        ▼
  Open PR ──► quality-scan.yml runs on the PR diff      [Level 3]
        │       → report as artifact + PR comment
        ▼
  Reviewer reads findings + AI review, requests changes if needed
        ▼
  All clear → merge.  The defect never reaches main.
```

**Best practice: use both layers** — local hooks for instant feedback, CI as the
enforcement that can't be skipped.

## 10. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Everything Python shows `SKIP`** | Those tools aren't installed / not on PATH | `pip install ruff mypy bandit pip-audit` |
| **A JS tool shows `SKIP`** even though installed globally | JS tools must be **local** to the project | `npm install -D eslint prettier typescript` inside the project |
| **`npm audit` → ERROR `ENOLOCK`** | No `package-lock.json` | `npm i --package-lock-only` once, or disable `npm-audit` in config |
| **`tsc` says "Could not find a declaration file for 'pg'"** | Real project gap, not a scanner bug | `npm i -D @types/pg` (the gate faithfully reports your `tsc` output) |
| **AI review says "skipped"** | `claude` not on PATH, **or** you used `--all`, **or** the diff is empty | Install Claude Code; drop `--all` (AI is diff-based) |
| **"not a git repository — scanning the whole project"** | You're outside a git repo | Expected; it falls back to `--all` automatically |
| **A tool timed out (`ERROR`)** | Very large repo | Raise it: `qg --timeout 1200` |
| **First run floods me with issues** | You used `--all` on a legacy repo | Drop `--all` — the default scans only *your* changes |
| **Report didn't appear** | You used `--no-report`, or the out dir wasn't writable | Remove `--no-report`, or set `--out` to a writable folder |

## 11. Cheat sheet

```
# --- daily (local) ---
qg                          # scan my changes + AI review  ← use this most
qg --no-ai                  # faster, offline, just linters/types/security
qg --ai-full                # deep 6-reviewer AI pass before an important PR
qg --staged                 # only staged changes (pre-commit)
qg --base v1.4.0            # everything since a release
qg --path ..\repo --all --no-ai   # one-time full audit of another repo
qg --strict                 # exit 1 on findings (hooks / CI gating)
qg --no-report              # console only, write nothing

# --- what it is ---
# qg = node E:\MarketInk\Quality_Gate\quality-gate\scan.js
# Report → ./quality-reports/latest.md (in the folder you ran it from)
# READ-ONLY: never edits code, never touches git, never installs anything.

# --- install tools (only what a project uses) ---
pip install ruff mypy bandit pip-audit          # Python (on PATH)
npm install -D eslint prettier typescript       # JS/TS/React/Next (in project)
winget install gitleaks.gitleaks                # secrets (on PATH)
# + Claude Code on PATH for AI review

# --- statuses ---
PASS = clean   FINDINGS = fix these   SKIP = tool missing / nothing in scope
ERROR = tool crashed/timed out   OFF = disabled in config

# --- automate ---
# Level 1: pre-commit  → advisory (QG_BLOCK=1 to block)
# Level 2: pre-push    → fuller scan (QG_BLOCK=1 to block push on findings)
# Level 3: .github/workflows/quality-scan.yml → runs on every PR + PR comment
```

## 12. Notes: migration & roadmap

### Migration `scan.py` → `scan.js` (done)

The scanner was migrated from a Python file (`scan.py`) to a single Node file
(`scan.js`) with **zero npm dependencies** — because Node is already on every
machine and CI runner in an all-JS/TS org, while Python was the odd one out. It's a
**wrapper-language swap, not a redesign**: same two layers, same read-only
guarantee, same report format, and **all check specs kept** (including the Python
ones — the tool still scans Python projects by shelling out to `ruff`/`mypy`/
`bandit`/`pip-audit`). `scan.py` is kept one release as a fallback, then removed.

> Windows note: npm-installed bins are `.cmd` shims (`eslint.cmd`, `tsc.cmd`,
> `npm.cmd`); the scanner resolves the absolute path via its `which`/`localBin`
> helpers and runs it without a shell. Node's `spawnSync` timeout is in **ms** (the
> `--timeout` seconds are converted).

### Built today

- ✅ `scan.js` — read-only scanner (Node, zero deps): 11 deterministic checks +
  Claude AI review, with 6 specialized AI reviewers under `--ai-full`.
- ✅ Built-in Supabase check + dedicated Supabase AI reviewer (§8).
- ✅ Wrappers (`quality.ps1`, `quality`), optional config, `CLAUDE.template.md`.
- ✅ One-time hook installer (`hooks/install-hooks.*`) + `pre-commit`/`pre-push`.
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI workflow — non-blocking, uploads artifact, **posts the report
  as a PR comment** and updates it on re-runs.
- ✅ Markdown + JSON + timestamped reports.

### Roadmap

- ⏳ A `quality init` command that bootstraps a project automatically.
- ⏳ A three-level `quality quick / review / release` CLI wrapper.
- ⏳ `.claude/commands/` slash-command reviewers and a pre-commit-framework config.
- ⏳ AI-in-CI (Claude review on every PR) and a team metrics dashboard.

*Read-only by design. It tells you what's wrong; it never touches your code, your
git history, or your dependencies. The worst it can do is write a report.*
